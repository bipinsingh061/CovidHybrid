# Covid-19-detection-from-x-ray-using-hybrid-deep-learning-models
In this project, I implemented different types of models of deep learning like VGG-16, ResNet-50, CNN, and the hybrid approach. In hybrid models, I am concatenating VGG-16, VGG-19, and CNN, In another hybrid model I am concatenating VGG-16, VGG-19, and mobilenet.
